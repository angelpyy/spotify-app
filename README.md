# spotify-app
Random spotify app written in python that will retrieve every (first) saturday of the past 10 years and then scrape the billboards top 100 charts for that week and make a playlist based off those songs.

You can look at the fruits of my labor here https://open.spotify.com/user/31ryoo7v4vvrhjjiihqdtpcu3ezu

The program didn't finish running I wish I knew why. I'm going to assume rate limiting but realistically I don't even know what that means teehee.
(I finished it but I was looking through some of the playlists and I'm realizing I should've also used the API to search by artist and not just name bc some of these songs are simply not correct.)

Another thing to note, billboard apparently has these links active for dates that habe yet to come; they just have no songs. Fix that maybe possibly, consider it at least? (me on the program so if I put a bad date I dont just get a million emoty playlists.)
